    <P>Spend some fun time with friends and family in Lucknow at Gautam Buddha Park. Ideal for travellers of every age, especially kids, Gautam Buddha Park is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Lucknow. Located in Hasanganj, near to Bara Imambara, the park is a nice evening tourist spot in Lucknow to beat blistering heat of summer. The park was established in the year 1980 and since then it has been one of the mainstays of Lucknow tourism. Along with the lush greenery, this popular tourist site in Lucknow also includes kid's rides, electric swings and paddle boats.</P>

<P> Gautam Buddha Park is also an ideal place for picnicking and day outing with friends and families, especially during the winter season. The park boasts an ample space for kids to play, adults to take a stroll and elderly people to indulge in yoga and meditation activities. One of the must do things in this park is the boating which takes you through three bridges - much like that of in Venice. On the whole, Gautam Buddha Park is certainly a must-visit tourist attraction in Lucknow in order to add another beautiful experience on the trip to Lucknow.</P>
