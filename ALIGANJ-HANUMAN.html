    <p>The Nawabs of Lucknow were the forerunners of the secular culture, and the Lord Hanuman Ji Temple in Aliganj, Lucknow, is a magnificent example of that. This beautiful temple was built by the wife of Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah, Begum Rabiya. If you think this fact makes it one of the most incredible places to visit in Lucknow, wait till you hear the story behind its construction.</p>

    <p>It is believed that the Begum had a dream in which she came across an idol of Lord Hanuman hidden inside a particular spot in a garden. An unknown voice then advised her to dig the idol out and install it in the temple. Nobody knew who, how, and if, anybody placed it there. It was not long afterwards that she was blessed with a child. Convinced that there was a divine hand at play behind these events, the Nawab ordered the construction of a temple in close proximity to Bara Imambara with the statue inside it. It is this temple which is known as the Purana Hanuman Mandir, or the Old Hanuman Temple.</p>

    <p>I should probably curse myself, as (again) despite regularly coming to Aliganj on my Lucknow trips, I never knew about this temple. Those who doubt Indiaâ€™s secular ideals should know that this temple, according to lore, was founded by the wife of the third Nawab of Lucknow, Shuja-ud-Daulah, Begum Janab-e-Alia! The temple is the focal point of the celebrations of Bada Mangal, meaning Big Tuesday, an event which can fall 4-5 times during May-June.

    Location: Sector L, Aliganj, Lucknow
    Timings: 5:00 am to 12:00 pm and 4:00 pm to 9:00 pm</p>
