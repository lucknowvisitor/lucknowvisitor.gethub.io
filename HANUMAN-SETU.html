  <body>
    <p>Inaugurated on January 26, 1967, this ashram includes 2 Neem Karoli Baba murtis, 2 Hanuman murtis, and 2 Shiva Linga.

This temple performs a major service in distributing Maharajji's prasad in Lucknow, and seems to be one of the most visited temples in the city.

The ashram is always decorated as for a bhandara, thanks to a devoted staff. Maharajji said that Lucknow Sankat Mochan Hanuman-ji (known as "the wish fulfilling Hanuman") is "the Governor General of all Hanumans."

Wall murals depict: Ram and Sita, and Ram and Laxshman with Hanuman and the army of monkeys and bears building the bridge to Lanka.

A Mahasamadhi Bhandara is held here shortly after the mahasamadhi bhandara in Kanpur. A very limited number of Westerners are occasionally accommodated at this ashram.

<p>When I was young, one of the regular things to do in Lucknow for me would be to visit Hanuman Setu Mandir, also known as Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple. The temple was founded on the banks of the Gomti River in the 1960s by Neem Karoli Baba of Kainchi, Uttarakhand, whom my family reveres a lot. My maternal grandfather (nana) used to volunteer for the priestly activities here every Tuesday, reaching the shrine early morning. There are two distinct sections of the temple: one housing an idol of Lord Hanuman and the other of Neem Karoli Baba.

Location: University Road, Babuganj, Lucknow
Timings: 4:00 am to 11:00 am and 4:00 pm to 12:00 am
Oh, just so you know, the temple is quite close to Hazratganj, one of the best places for street shopping in Lucknow.</p>
