<h2><b>HISTORY</b></h2>
<p>The Rumi Darwaza (Gate) is an incredible structure which stands imposingly between Bara Imambara and Chota Imambara in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh.
  Constructed in 1784 under the rule of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, it is a fine example of Awadhi architecture, or the Lucknow School of Architecture.
  It was a style adopted by the Nawabs of Awadh to preserve the Mughal architectural style while experimenting with newer styles and materials.</p>

<p>The Rumi Darwaza, one of the heritage attractions in Uttar Pradesh.
  Is also referred to as Turkish Gate because it bears a strong similarity in design to a gateway built in ancient Constantinople (todayâ€™s Turkey) called Bab-i-Humayun.
  Standing at an impressive height of 60ft, it once served as the entrance to Old Lucknow City.
  Today however, you find the gate looking on as auto rickshaws, bicycles and vehicles speed along underneath it.
  If you think this gateway looks beautiful during the daytime, wait till you see it illuminated during the evening</p>
